# General-MultiplexBayes

This repository contains R programs of the article, "Estimating the prevalence of two or more diseases using outcomes from multiplex group testing." Two main R functions (mult.gt.bayes and mult.gt.bayes_L2) are provided to implement the posterior sampling algorithm and the EM algorithm proposed in Warasi et al. (2022+). This article uses multiplex group testing data for estimating the coinfection probabilities and the assay accuracy probabilities (sensitivity and specificity).

R code of the simulation examples in the article is split into three files:

1. Simulation1.R -- to reproduce the estimation results shown in Table D.1 (in Web Appendix D).

2. Simulation2.R -- to reproduce the estimation results shown in Tables 2-3 (in the article).

3. Simulation3.R -- to reproduce the estimation results shown in Tables D.3-D.8 (in Web Appendix D).
